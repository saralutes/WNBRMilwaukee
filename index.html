                <h4 class="list">About us</h4>
                <p>We are a group focused on promoting body positivity, cyclist awareness, and energy independence in Milwaukee Wisconsin via an annual WNBR event. This is a clothing-optional "bare as you dare" peaceful protest with an approximately 15 mile pre-planned bike ride in the streets of Milwaukee Wisconsin. Everyone is welcome!</p>
                <p>For more information on the ride, route, and to register (for planning purposes) please join <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/wnbrmilwaukee/about/" target="_blank" class="text-link">Facebook Group</a>.</p>
                <h4 class="list">Our Message</h4>
                <p>WNBR (World Naked Bike Ride) focuses on promoting the following messages through peaceful protest:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><h5 class="">Save the planet</h5> Shifting to a carfree lifestyle is one of the most powerful things a person can do to make a real difference in reducing negative environmental impacts on this planet.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><h5 class="">Body Positivity</h5>Cycling promotes body awareness, the fact that one can achieve a more healthy lifestyle from the exercise we achive by using self-powered transport.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><h5 class="">Self-sufficiency</h5>Cycling makes us non-renewable energy sources, less dependent oil.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><h5 class="">Cycling Advocacy</h5>Bicycles create public space, enhance street life and build a sense of community. Cycling promotes local cycling businesses and local cycling organizations. We face automobile traffic with our naked bodies as the best way of defending our dignity and exposing the vulnerability faced by cyclists and pedestrians on our streets as well as the negative consequences we all face due to dependence on oil, and other forms of non-renewable energy.</li>
                </ul>

        <p class="cntr">These questions and answers come from the World Naked Bike Ride Wiki page. More FAQs can be found on the <a class="text-link" href="http://wiki.worldnakedbikeride.org/index.php?title=Frequently_asked_questions" target="_blank">WNBR FAQ</a> page.</p>
        <div>
            <ul class="list-group-flush">
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5>Isn't riding naked uncomfortable?</h5>
                    <p>Suprisingly, for both women and men, riding naked isn't especially less comfortable than riding clothed. When riding with clothes on you're often rubbing against the seams, so in some ways naked riding is comfier! Ride routes will often be chosen with less experienced cyclists in mind, so will avoid hills and be more leisurely in pace, increasing comfort.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5>Is it legal to be naked in public?</h5>
                    <p>It depends on the laws of the country that individual rides take place in. Public nudity is often more acceptable than you'd think, so long as the behaviour of the naked people in question isn't lewd, aggressive or violent. Even if the local law prohibits nudity, police typically won't take action to cite/arrest riders participating in a large group ride that is also a political protest protected by the First Amendment - safety in numbers and the Constitution!</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5>Why are you riding naked?</h5>
                    <p>To celebrate cycling and the human body. The ride demonstrates the vulnerability of cyclists on the road and is a protest against oil dependency.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5>Do I have to ride a bike?</h5>
                    <p>No! Any sort of skates (skateboards, inline skates, rollerskates, rollerblades etc) are welcome too. You won't be able to keep up with rides travelling on foot, but any alternate body-powered transport is welcome and encouraged. Several events have people riding on skates, unicycles, tricycles, chopper bikes, tandems, recumbants and rickshaws. The only sort of bikes that would be unwelcome would be petrol-powered motorbikes and scooters.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5>Do I have to get fully nude?</h5>
                    <p>No! Nudity isn't required to participate in this ride. All rides around the world are clothing optional. The dress code is 'bare as you dare', so please try to challenge yourself. Wear as little as you can while still feeling comfortable about it.
                    Last year, people came wearing shorts, bra-tops, swim-wear, body paint/masks, etc. There will be plenty of people who will cycle fully nude, so don't feel that it is your duty to do this if you aren't comfortable showing all of your body. Many people find they get more confident as the ride progresses, so feel free to peel off as you go!</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5>Do I have to ride naked? Can I participate clothed or top-free?</h5>
                    <p>The World Naked Bike Ride dress code is "as bare as you dare". How bare is that? How much do you dare? It's all up to you: you decide what you are comfortable with. The ride is clothing-optional.</p>
                    <p>No one is excluded or discriminated against based on levels of clothing, body paint, or anything else for that matter!</p>
                    <p>While nudity isn't required to participate in this ride we encourage you to challenge yourself. Wear as little as you can while still feeling comfortable about it. Last year, people came wearing shorts, bras, swimwear, body paint, masks etc. There will be plenty of people who will cycle fully nude, so don't feel that it is your duty to do this if you aren't comfortable showing all of your body. Respect your own boundaries, and go As Bare As You Dare!</p>

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5>Can I hurt myself cycling nude?</h5>
                    <p>Only if you don't wear any sunscreen or if you fall off the bike. We recommend that you wear sunscreen, footwear and a helmet. Ride carefully and you won't get hurt. Your bottom will probably not hurt any more than when you ride with your clothes on. If you get sore (with or without clothes), it could be that you have the wrong shape of saddle. Aside from getting a saddle that fits you better, you could get a padded bike seat, or gel sadle-cover. If you haven't been on a bike for years, your bottom may feel sore after the first few rides, so you might want to get in practice by cycling more often before the WNBR day.</p>

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5>What does it feel like to ride nude?</h5>
                    <p>Just like it does with clothes but a bit cooler. Most riders also find it exhilerating, liberating, empowering... and downright hilarious!</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5>What about hygiene? My private parts will touch the seat!</h5>
                    <p>Indeed they will! Some people fear that they will catch something from the seat or make the seat dirty just by sitting on it naked. Unless you (or your seat) have particularly terrible hygiene already, there won't be a problem. There hasn't been a single report of this problem occurring in the many years of people cycling in the nude. For those that are still worried, here's the simple solution. Before the ride - 1. Have a wash. 2. clean off your seat - and/or - put something on your seat like a small rag.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5>What if I'm not conventionally attractive?</h5>
                    <p>Great! Please come to the ride! We'll all be there to ride with you in celebration of your body's strength and individuality. People of all ages, sizes, builds and appearances ride on World Naked Bike Ride. At the ride, you'll be treated with dignity and respect no matter what your body looks like. One of the amazing impacts of this ride is to show the world how varied real bodies can be; unlike the airbrushed images that flood the media and cause so much insecurity.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5>Should I wear shoes?</h5>
                    <p>If you're not sure about this then you should wear some sort of footwear. This is especially recommended if you have rough pedals. Sandals or flipflops may do, but closed-toe shoes are safer. Most riders use footwear for safety and comfort reasons. If you're still planning to ride barefoot, it's advisable to try this out on an urban ride before cycling barefoot on World Naked Bike Ride.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5>This is a protest event, so can I bring placards etc? What message should I communicate?</h5>
                    <p>We recommend bringing something that communicates the messages of the ride (opposition to oil dependency and celebration of our bodies). You could paint the message onto your body, you could mount a sign/object/flag onto your bicycle, or you might want to wear a prop (mask, wings, tail, etc). Use your imagination!

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5>Isn't public nudity offensive?</h5>
                    <p>People are offended by all kinds of harmless things, people and ideas. People have been offended by religous cartoons, Muslims converting to Christianity (in Afganistan), farting, burping, Martin Luther King, Jesus, Gandhi, the accidental exposure of Janet Jackson's breast, rock'n'roll, sex education, tattoos, dancing, the peace movement, environmentalists, droopy pants, "minority" groups, potbellies, hairy chests, Teletubbies, and most likely even you at some point.</p>

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5>What does cycling naked have to do with environmental protest?</h5>
                    <p>We face automobile traffic with our naked bodies as the best way of defending our dignity and exposing the unique dangers faced by cyclists and pedestrians as well as the negative consequences we all face due to dependence on oil, and other forms of non-renewable energy.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5>It looks more like a party than a protest. Why should it be taken seriously, politically?</h5>
                    <p>Having fun and doing public outreach are not mutually exclusive goals. People see us on the streets and you can see the gears turning in their heads. People see a large group of cyclists and they think to themselves, what is this, why are they doing that? It won't take long for them to figure out that by doing something different, by immersing ourselves in lanes intended for cars and not for bicycles, by tossing our clothes and rejecting our shame, we are protesting a way of life which needs to be abandoned.

                        We paint our bodies with political messages or beautiful designs to complement our forms. We pass out flyers informing the public about our message. We use portable public address systems or raise our voices and chant in unison
                        
                        Getting people to laugh and smile is a great way to connect and share ideas in a non-threatening way. We realize there will always be the occasional grinch that just can't share the road with cyclists or stand the sight of a natural human being. Fortunately for us, their numbers are decreasing and ours are increasing.</p>
